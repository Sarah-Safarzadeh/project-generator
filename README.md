## UT Coding Bootcamp - Week 09: Node.js - Modular Activity
### Challenge assignment: create a generator that dynamically produces a high-quality README file directly from the command line.
* Modularize your code into multiple files

* Write your code using ES6+ concepts, such as let, const, and arrow functions

* Use npm (Node Package Manager) to initialize a project and install and import Node.js modules

* Build an interactive command-line application that processes user input using a third-party Node.js module

* Use string literals to dynamically generate markdown from the command line

#### Learned How To:

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the Node.js standard library

* Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as let, const, and arrow functions

* Handle asynchronicity with callbacks and Promises
